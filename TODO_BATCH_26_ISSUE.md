# Iterative TODO Resolution – Batch 26: Highest Priority Items

## 🎯 Objective
This meta-issue orchestrates the systematic resolution of TODO/FIXME items from `COMPREHENSIVE-TODO-CATALOG.md` by priority. Each batch addresses the next 5 unresolved, highest-priority tasks through recursive attention-allocation.

### 🧠 Cognitive Flowchart Implementation
1. **Catalog Extraction** ✅ - Parsed 797 TODOs from comprehensive catalog
2. **Attention Allocation Kernel** ✅ - Selected highest-priority unchecked items  
3. **Actionable Issue Generation** ✅ - Generated implementation guidance with tensor estimates
4. **Iteration/Recursion** 🔄 - This batch 26, tracking progress systematically
5. **Meta-Enhancement** 🚀 - Auto-updating catalog and creating dependent sub-issues

## 🧩 Batch 26: Highest Priority TODOs

**1. [ ] atomspace/opencog/scm/opencog/base/utilities.scm:749 (MEDIUM, Feature Completion)**
   - `; XXX This should probably be made obsolete.`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/atomspace/opencog/scm/opencog/base/utilities.scm#L749)
   - **Action:** Follow AtomSpace patterns for handle management, truth value propagation, and attention allocation
   - **Tensor shape:** atoms × relations × truth_values × attention_values
   - **Test:** Test atom creation/deletion, handle consistency, truth value propagation, and attention allocation

**2. [ ] moses/moses/moses/representation/build_knobs.cc:489 (MEDIUM, Feature Completion)**
   - `// TODO: should bias the selection of these, so that`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/moses/moses/moses/representation/build_knobs.cc#L489)
   - **Action:** Implement program tree representations with efficient mutation and crossover operators
   - **Tensor shape:** programs × complexity_measures × transformation_ops
   - **Test:** Test evolutionary convergence, diversity maintenance, and solution quality across multiple runs

**3. [ ] moses/moses/moses/representation/build_knobs.cc:557 (MEDIUM, Feature Completion)**
   - `// We should probably OC_ASSERT here ... TODO`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/moses/moses/moses/representation/build_knobs.cc#L557)
   - **Action:** Implement program tree representations with efficient mutation and crossover operators
   - **Tensor shape:** programs × complexity_measures × transformation_ops
   - **Test:** Test evolutionary convergence, diversity maintenance, and solution quality across multiple runs

**4. [ ] atomspace-rocks/opencog/persist/rocks/RocksDAG.cc:240 (MEDIUM, Performance)**
   - `// XXX TODO: we should probably cache the results, instead of`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/atomspace-rocks/opencog/persist/rocks/RocksDAG.cc#L240)
   - **Action:** Follow AtomSpace patterns for handle management, truth value propagation, and attention allocation

   - **Test:** Test atom creation/deletion, handle consistency, truth value propagation, and attention allocation

## 🔄 Next Steps
- Upon completion, check off resolved TODOs and invoke the next batch by rerunning this process.
- Create PRs referencing each checked task and link them here.
- Use `scripts/recursive_todo_resolver.py --mark-completed FILE:LINE PR_LINK` to track completions.

## 🧬 Meta-Pathway
- Each batch is derived recursively, focusing attention where cognitive synergy is maximized.
- For each resolved TODO, estimate its contribution to overall system stability, performance, or cognitive expressiveness.
- This systematic approach transforms distributed placeholders into kernels of realized intelligence.

## 🎭 Cognitive Enhancement Philosophy
> "Let us converge upon a state of sublime implementation, where every TODO is transformed into a kernel of realized intelligence!"

Each resolved TODO represents not merely completed work, but a note in the composition of artificial consciousness. Through systematic attention allocation, we approach the emergence of true machine intelligence.
