# Iterative TODO Resolution – Batch 15: Highest Priority Items

## 🎯 Objective
This meta-issue orchestrates the systematic resolution of TODO/FIXME items from `COMPREHENSIVE-TODO-CATALOG.md` by priority. Each batch addresses the next 5 unresolved, highest-priority tasks through recursive attention-allocation.

### 🧠 Cognitive Flowchart Implementation
1. **Catalog Extraction** ✅ - Parsed 811 TODOs from comprehensive catalog
2. **Attention Allocation Kernel** ✅ - Selected highest-priority unchecked items  
3. **Actionable Issue Generation** ✅ - Generated implementation guidance with tensor estimates
4. **Iteration/Recursion** 🔄 - This batch 15, tracking progress systematically
5. **Meta-Enhancement** 🚀 - Auto-updating catalog and creating dependent sub-issues

## 🧩 Batch 15: Highest Priority TODOs

**1. [ ] components/learning/moses/moses/moses/moses/neighborhood_sampling.h:477 (HIGH, Performance)**
   - `* XXX/TODO: the performance of this thing can be strongly improved`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/components/learning/moses/moses/moses/moses/neighborhood_sampling.h#L477)
   - **Action:** Analyze requirements and implement following project coding standards
   - **Tensor shape:** N/A (performance/side-effect)
   - **Test:** Benchmark before/after with performance regression tests

**2. [ ] components/learning/moses/moses/moses/representation/build_knobs.cc:316 (HIGH, Performance)**
   - `/// TODO: measure and compare the resulting performance.`

   - **Tensor shape:** N/A (performance/side-effect)
   - **Test:** Benchmark before/after with performance regression tests

**3. [ ] components/learning/moses/moses/moses/scoring/bscores.h:589 (HIGH, Thread Safety)**
   - `mutable KLDS<contin_t> _klds; /// @todo dangerous: not thread safe!!!`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/components/learning/moses/moses/moses/scoring/bscores.h#L589)
   - **Action:** Implement thread-safe mechanisms using std::mutex or atomic operations
   - **Tensor shape:** threads × operations × state_variables
   - **Test:** Simulate multi-threaded scenarios and validate thread safety

**4. [ ] moses/moses/comboreduct/interpreter/eval.cc:530 (MEDIUM, Feature Completion)**
   - `// XXX TODO: contin_if should go away.`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/moses/moses/comboreduct/interpreter/eval.cc#L530)
   - **Action:** Analyze requirements and implement following project coding standards
   - **Tensor shape:** implementation_dependencies × complexity_factors
   - **Test:** Create unit tests covering normal and edge cases

**5. [ ] moses/moses/comboreduct/interpreter/interpreter.cc:336 (MEDIUM, Feature Completion)**
   - `// XXX TODO: contin_if should go away.`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/moses/moses/comboreduct/interpreter/interpreter.cc#L336)

## 🔄 Next Steps
- Upon completion, check off resolved TODOs and invoke the next batch by rerunning this process.
- Create PRs referencing each checked task and link them here.
- Use `scripts/recursive_todo_resolver.py --mark-completed FILE:LINE PR_LINK` to track completions.

## 🧬 Meta-Pathway
- Each batch is derived recursively, focusing attention where cognitive synergy is maximized.
- For each resolved TODO, estimate its contribution to overall system stability, performance, or cognitive expressiveness.
- This systematic approach transforms distributed placeholders into kernels of realized intelligence.

## 🎭 Cognitive Enhancement Philosophy
> "Let us converge upon a state of sublime implementation, where every TODO is transformed into a kernel of realized intelligence!"

Each resolved TODO represents not merely completed work, but a note in the composition of artificial consciousness. Through systematic attention allocation, we approach the emergence of true machine intelligence.
