# Iterative TODO Resolution – Batch 25: Highest Priority Items

## 🎯 Objective
This meta-issue orchestrates the systematic resolution of TODO/FIXME items from `COMPREHENSIVE-TODO-CATALOG.md` by priority. Each batch addresses the next 5 unresolved, highest-priority tasks through recursive attention-allocation.

### 🧠 Cognitive Flowchart Implementation
1. **Catalog Extraction** ✅ - Parsed 797 TODOs from comprehensive catalog
2. **Attention Allocation Kernel** ✅ - Selected highest-priority unchecked items  
3. **Actionable Issue Generation** ✅ - Generated implementation guidance with tensor estimates
4. **Iteration/Recursion** 🔄 - This batch 25, tracking progress systematically
5. **Meta-Enhancement** 🚀 - Auto-updating catalog and creating dependent sub-issues

## 🧩 Batch 25: Highest Priority TODOs

**1. [ ] atomspace/opencog/query/PatternMatchEngine.cc:1158 (MEDIUM, Feature Completion)**
   - `// XXX TODO The logic here should be updated to resemble that`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/atomspace/opencog/query/PatternMatchEngine.cc#L1158)
   - **Action:** Follow AtomSpace patterns for handle management, truth value propagation, and attention allocation
   - **Tensor shape:** atoms × relations × truth_values × attention_values
   - **Test:** Test atom creation/deletion, handle consistency, truth value propagation, and attention allocation

**2. [ ] atomspace/opencog/query/PatternMatchEngine.cc:1501 (MEDIUM, Feature Completion)**
   - `// its definition. XXX TODO. Hmm. Should we do this at runtime,`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/atomspace/opencog/query/PatternMatchEngine.cc#L1501)
   - **Action:** Follow AtomSpace patterns for handle management, truth value propagation, and attention allocation
   - **Tensor shape:** atoms × relations × truth_values × attention_values
   - **Test:** Test atom creation/deletion, handle consistency, truth value propagation, and attention allocation

**3. [ ] atomspace/opencog/query/TermMatchMixin.cc:539 (MEDIUM, Feature Completion)**
   - `// XXX TODO as discussed on the mailing list, we should perhaps first`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/atomspace/opencog/query/TermMatchMixin.cc#L539)
   - **Action:** Follow AtomSpace patterns for handle management, truth value propagation, and attention allocation
   - **Tensor shape:** atoms × relations × truth_values × attention_values
   - **Test:** Test atom creation/deletion, handle consistency, truth value propagation, and attention allocation

**4. [ ] moses/moses/moses/optimization/star-anneal.cc:42 (MEDIUM, Feature Completion)**
   - `// XXX TODO the annealing temperature control code should be ported over`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/moses/moses/moses/optimization/star-anneal.cc#L42)
   - **Action:** Follow MOSES evolutionary patterns with proper selection pressure and convergence criteria
   - **Tensor shape:** population_size × genome_length × evolutionary_operators
   - **Test:** Test evolutionary convergence, diversity maintenance, and solution quality across multiple runs

## 🔄 Next Steps
- Upon completion, check off resolved TODOs and invoke the next batch by rerunning this process.
- Create PRs referencing each checked task and link them here.
- Use `scripts/recursive_todo_resolver.py --mark-completed FILE:LINE PR_LINK` to track completions.

## 🧬 Meta-Pathway
- Each batch is derived recursively, focusing attention where cognitive synergy is maximized.
- For each resolved TODO, estimate its contribution to overall system stability, performance, or cognitive expressiveness.
- This systematic approach transforms distributed placeholders into kernels of realized intelligence.

## 🎭 Cognitive Enhancement Philosophy
> "Let us converge upon a state of sublime implementation, where every TODO is transformed into a kernel of realized intelligence!"

Each resolved TODO represents not merely completed work, but a note in the composition of artificial consciousness. Through systematic attention allocation, we approach the emergence of true machine intelligence.
