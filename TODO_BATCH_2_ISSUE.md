# Iterative TODO Resolution – Batch 2: Highest Priority Items

## 🎯 Objective
This meta-issue orchestrates the systematic resolution of TODO/FIXME items from `COMPREHENSIVE-TODO-CATALOG.md` by priority. Each batch addresses the next 5 unresolved, highest-priority tasks.

## 🧩 Batch 2: Highest Priority TODOs

**1. [ ] components/learning/moses/moses/feature-selection/algo/simple.h:118 (HIGH, Performance)**
   - `// performance... TODO try this, if this is actually a bottleneck.`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/components/learning/moses/moses/feature-selection/algo/simple.h#L118)
   - **Action:** Analyze requirements and implement following project coding standards
   - **Tensor shape:** N/A (performance/side-effect)
   - **Test:** Benchmark before/after with performance regression tests

**2. [ ] components/learning/moses/moses/moses/moses/neighborhood_sampling.h:477 (HIGH, Performance)**
   - `* XXX/TODO: the performance of this thing can be strongly improved`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/components/learning/moses/moses/moses/moses/neighborhood_sampling.h#L477)
   - **Action:** Analyze requirements and implement following project coding standards
   - **Tensor shape:** N/A (performance/side-effect)
   - **Test:** Benchmark before/after with performance regression tests

**3. [ ] components/learning/moses/moses/moses/representation/build_knobs.cc:316 (HIGH, Performance)**
   - `/// TODO: measure and compare the resulting performance.`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/components/learning/moses/moses/moses/representation/build_knobs.cc#L316)
   - **Action:** Analyze requirements and implement following project coding standards
   - **Tensor shape:** N/A (performance/side-effect)
   - **Test:** Benchmark before/after with performance regression tests

**4. [ ] components/learning/moses/moses/moses/scoring/bscores.h:589 (HIGH, Thread Safety)**
   - `mutable KLDS<contin_t> _klds; /// @todo dangerous: not thread safe!!!`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/components/learning/moses/moses/moses/scoring/bscores.h#L589)
   - **Action:** Implement thread-safe mechanisms using std::mutex or atomic operations
   - **Tensor shape:** threads × operations × state_variables
   - **Test:** Simulate multi-threaded scenarios and validate thread safety

**5. [ ] moses/moses/comboreduct/table/table.h:1288 (HIGH, Performance)**
   - `// XXX TODO remove this print, for better performance.`
   - [Code reference](https://github.com/OzCog/opencog-unified/blob/25d11bfe332cd501a967d9ab3a6957a22504249f/moses/moses/comboreduct/table/table.h#L1288)
   - **Action:** Remove or gate debug prints behind compile-time or runtime flags
   - **Tensor shape:** N/A (performance/side-effect)
   - **Test:** Benchmark before/after with performance regression tests

## 🔄 Next Steps
- Upon completion, check off resolved TODOs and invoke the next batch by rerunning this process.
- Create PRs referencing each checked task and link them here.

## 🧬 Meta-Pathway
- Each batch is derived recursively, focusing attention where cognitive synergy is maximized.
- For each resolved TODO, estimate its contribution to overall system stability, performance, or cognitive expressiveness.

## 🕰️ Progress Log
- **Last run:** 2025-07-26
- **Remaining high-priority TODOs:** 24
- **Total TODOs processed:** 0
- **Current iteration:** 2
