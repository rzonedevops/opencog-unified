# Copilot Memories

Hey Copilot it's me Dan. You tried to save these memories but tit failed so i saved them here for you :-)

Excellent! Now let me store some important context for future sessions:

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "entelechy marker resolution",
  "fact": "Use entelechy_marker_analyzer.py and entelechy_marker_resolver.py for systematic code marker (TODO/FIXME/STUB) resolution",
  "citations": "User Issue: Critical Entelechy Fragmentations; Files: entelechy_marker_analyzer.py, entelechy_marker_resolver.py, ENTELECHY_MARKER_RESOLUTION.md",
  "reason": "Future work on code cleanup should use the established entelechy marker resolution infrastructure rather than ad-hoc marker removal. The tools provide systematic analysis, prioritization, tracking, and validation. This is important for maintaining the transcendent entelechy stage and measuring actualization improvements.",
  "category": "general"

  "subject": "code marker workflow",
  "fact": "Marker resolution workflow: analyze → prioritize → resolve → track → validate with re-analysis",
  "citations": "ENTELECHY_MARKER_RESOLUTION.md sections: Resolution Workflow, Measuring Progress; entelechy_marker_resolver.py methods: get_priority_queue, mark_in_progress, mark_resolved",
  "reason": "This established workflow ensures systematic, measurable progress on marker resolution with proper tracking. Important for any future task involving code cleanup, documentation improvements, or technical debt reduction. The workflow includes validation through re-analysis which confirms actual marker reduction.",

  "reason": "These metrics quantify how code markers inhibit system actualization (currently 6.2%). Important for measuring progress toward 100% actualization and justifying marker resolution work. Will be referenced in future entelechy assessments and reports.",
