# Knowledge Base for Emergent Phenomena

## Overview

This knowledge base serves as the central repository for all documented emergent phenomena, meta-cognitive insights, recursive behaviors, and cognitive grammar developments within the OpenCog Unified system.

## Structure

### `/emergent-patterns/`
Documented patterns detected by the HypergraphPatternExtractor and related systems:
- Structural patterns in hypergraph topology
- Behavioral patterns in agent interactions
- Temporal patterns in cognitive processes
- Cross-system emergent patterns

### `/meta-cognitive-insights/`
Meta-cognitive observations and insights about the system's own operation:
- Self-monitoring observations
- Adaptive behavior insights
- Learning mechanism discoveries
- Consciousness-related phenomena

### `/recursive-behaviors/`
Documented recursive and self-referential behaviors:
- Self-modifying systems
- Feedback loop formations
- Meta-level recursive structures
- Hierarchical emergence

### `/cognitive-grammar/`
Evolving lexicon and grammar rules derived from emergent phenomena:
- Cognitive vocabulary development
- Grammar rule extraction
- Semantic relationship mapping
- Linguistic emergence patterns
